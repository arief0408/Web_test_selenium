1. Can you tell us about your passion?
I always interested in automation, before i know QA automation is a career choice, i enjoy messing around with selenium by making bot for instagram
automate process that im too lazy to do in manually. Also in my current company, when i develop a script to automate a process where it needed to do a lot of manual labour.
It made their job easier, and they can just run a script and leave it, instead of spending hours of their working time running 100+ tests one by one.
That put a smile on my face and become my passion from now on that i want to help someone with an automation.


2. Why do you want to be a QA Engineer?
Its always interested me to know what happened in a product that i used everyday, also sometimes my curiosity kicked in when i'm using something
I always try to figured it out to either destroy it, pushes it to its limit, or do something that can be done with the product.
And combine it with automation, i believe that i can done more testing with it.


3. What is your goal as a QA Engineer ?
My goal as a QA Engineer that i can develop an fully autonomous process where as a QA Engineer is needed only for bug/defect analysis.


4. How do you plan your goal as a QA Engineer ?
Right now im learning more tools that can made my job way easier, for example for test automation i started learn cypress where it can done web testing and API testing at the same time,
Allure where it can automate test reporting with an incredible UI, so yeah my plan for now is to learn everything until i able to achieve my goal.


5. What is your expectation, If you join with Catalyst as a QA Engineer ?
A working environment where it swarm by young and curios person that always dare to try something new. A possitive work environment that willing to teach and support me when i'm facing an issue.
